## Description

This project is a proof of concept for building SwedenCPP Meetup Group
web site using React, the idea is brought up by Harald and Oleksii on
the Group slack channel.

The purpose is to assess benefits and drawbacks in comparision to
server-based solution, especially ease of: 

- retriving of information on client side
- layout configuration

The web site is deployed here http://aexg.github.io/sweppweb

## Suggested next steps

- Add pages for other cities
- Add static texts describing the group
- Add placeholders for sponsors
- Edit CSS to make the site beautiful
